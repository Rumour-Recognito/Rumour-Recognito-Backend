8,"A video of a man confidently saying a hi-fi to burning metal is doing rounds on social media. “A really dramatic example of the Leidenfrost effect. The moisture on his skin boils instantly, forming a layer of steam that insulates for a very short time, a temporary barrier between this person and the molten metal,” the tweet was captioned."
9,"According to experts, when a liquid comes into contact with a hot surface, the liquid droplets do not evaporate instantaneously but simply hover over the surface. Here, an insulating vapor layer is produced. This called as Leidenfrost effect, was first reported in 1732 and described in more detail by Leidenfrost in 1756."
10,"Having seen the video, Elon Musk reacted and wrote, Don’t try this at home. Watch the video, right here:"

16,"The internet is a treasure trove of videos that can amaze one. Those videos not only share some incredible knowledge about science, they can also leave a person awe-struck. Just like this old video of a man touching hot molten metal."
17,"Shared on Twitter by Science Girl, the video shows a man sitting in front of an outlet of flowing molten metal. The man touches the metal twice briefly and then comes near the camera to show his hand which is completely unburnt!"
18,"“A really dramatic example of the Leidenfrost effect. The moisture on his skin boils instantly, forming a layer of steam that insulates for a very short time, a temporary barrier between this person and the molten metal,” explains the caption."

21,The video shared back in 2018 has gone viral again with more than 3.5 million views. People were shocked to see the man’s unburnt hand and enquired about the scientific explanation behind it.

47,The reason why the man was able to perform this deadly stunt is monikered by the science fraternity as the Leidenfrost effect. (Credits: Twitter)
48,"It wouldn’t be far-fetched to say that ‘science is magic’ and a video that recently surfaced on social media is evidence of the statement. In the video, a man is seen sitting right beside flowing molten metal. Moments later, the man starts slapping the falling molten metal with his bare hands and after hitting it a few times, shows his hands. The hand is as good as it was before he tried performing this mind-boggling stunt. The video, apart from raising hair, also raised doubts. Many passed off the video as fake, while many lauded the editing that went into churning out unbelievable visuals. However, nobody turned their attention toward science. As it turns out, the science checks out and the video is as real as it gets."
49,"The reason why the man was able to perform this deadly stunt is monikered by the science fraternity as the Leidenfrost effect. So, before getting into the explanation behind the phenomenon, take a look at the video."

57,"So, let’s dive into the phenomenon that allowed the man in the video to touch piping hot molten metal with his bare hands."
58,"The leidenfrost effect takes place when a liquid touches a surface that is much hotter than the liquids boiling point. As a result of extremely hot temperatures on the surface, the liquid produces an insulating layer of vapour that prevents the liquid to interact with the surface. This results in the droplets of the liquid keeping hovering or bouncing over the surface."
59,"In the video, the moisture of the man’s hands forms a layer of steam that insulates the surface of his hands. This temporary barrier prevents the hand from getting burned and blistered."
