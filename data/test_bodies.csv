34,"Update (11/17/2021 @ 01:56 ET): Samsung has officially shared the One UI 4.0 rollout timeline for the US. Scroll to the bottom for more information. The article as published on November 15, 2021, is preserved below."
35,"Over the last few weeks, Samsung has released One UI 4.0 beta updates based on Android 12 to quite a few of its devices. The flagship Galaxy S21 series has already received four closed beta builds of One UI 4.0, while older models like the Galaxy S20 series and Galaxy Note 20 series just joined the beta program. The company’s latest foldables, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, have also received beta builds of Samsung’s latest software skin, and a new notice on the Samsung Members app suggests that the stable builds might start rolling out soon."
36,"Hands-on with Samsung One UI 4.0 Beta 2: Theming, Virtual RAM, and more!"
37,"Samsung seems to have accidentally pushed a notice on the Samsung Members app (via @FrontTron), revealing the One UI 4.0 stable rollout schedule for its devices. As per the notice, One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 will start rolling out to the Galaxy S21 series this month, followed by the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy Note 20 series, Galaxy S20 series, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Galaxy Z Flip in December. Check out the image attached below to see when other devices in Samsung’s portfolio will receive the new update:"
38,(Via: @FrontTron)
39,"Samsung rolled out a similar notice on the Samsung Members app to users in Brazil. However, the rollout schedule isn’t the same in that region. As per a recent post on the Samsung community forums, the company plans to release stable builds of One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 in December this year, followed by the Galaxy S21 series, the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the Galaxy Z Flip, and Galaxy Z Fold 2 in January next year. See the table below for the rollout schedule for other Samsung devices in Brazil:"
40,"Note that Samsung has since removed the notice in both regions. This leads us to believe that the company is still ironing out the final details, and it may change the rollout schedule for some devices. However, Samsung seems to have finalized the One UI 4.0 rollout schedule for the Galaxy S21 series as Canadian telecom giants Rogers and Telus have confirmed that the Android 12 update will roll out to the devices on November 23. This suggests that unlocked models in other regions will likely receive the update by next week."
41,"Samsung has officially announced that the stable rollout of One UI 4.0 has officially begun, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra, with rollout beginning today. We’ll shortly be updating our One UI 4 Update Tracker with download links so you can easily sideload the new update."
42,"The company did not reveal further timelines beyond its flagship S series, but these are the devices that will get the update:"
43,"Samsung has now shared the official One UI 4.0 rollout timeline for the US region through the Samsung Members app (via Android Authority). As per the schedule, Samsung plans to release the stable Android 12 update to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 next month, followed by the Galaxy S20 series, Galaxy Note 20 series, and older foldables in January next year.

64,"In 2021, Google unveiled a newer version of Android (Android 12) earlier than usual. Samsung had announced in July 2021 that it would release the Android 12-based One UI 4 Beta software update to the Galaxy S21 series before releasing the stable version. On September 14, 2021, the company finally released the One UI 4 Beta update in some countries: Germany, South Korea, and the US. A few more countries—China, India, Poland, and the UK—got the update over the next few weeks. One UI 4.0 brings more than 60 new features to Galaxy smartphones, and we have listed and explained all of them in this article. We’ve also listed Galaxy smartphones and tablets that will get the One UI 4.0 update."
65,"On top of all the features Google introduced with Android 12, Samsung has added its own set of software features in One UI 4.0. The official One UI 4.0 update changelog mentions a lot of features to get excited about. The new version of One UI brings enhanced privacy and security features, some design UI changes, improved stock apps, more lock screen widgets, a new charging animation, AR Emoji improvements, and much more."
66,"Samsung has updated the home screen and icons with Google’s Material You-based Colour Palette feature. Based on the wallpaper you choose, you get the option to choose accent colours that are used across the whole UI. Those accent colours can also be applied to the app icons. But only some Samsung stock app icons change when you activate this feature."
67,"All stock widgets have also been redesigned. They now feature a new and slick styling and Dark and Light modes. Widgets now offer more information at a single glance. Additionally, you should see recommendations for widgets that may be useful for you. Moreover, the widgets selection menu has been simplified and offers a list view of all the available widgets."
68,"Samsung has also updated the Quick Settings Panel in One UI 4.0. It now has an enhanced layout and an integrated section for alerts and silent notifications. Additionally, Samsung has made the screen brightness bar thicker."
69,"The stock camera app in One UI 4.0 has received an update as well. The Scene Optimizer button now appears in Photo mode if the ambient light is low or if you are scanning a document. Settings for Portrait Mode and Night mode are now more intuitive. Samsung also has updated the settings layout in the Pro Mode. The Pro Mode now feels more organized and has a cleaner look. Last but not least, the Document Scanning feature has been improved to make fine editing easier using the zoom feature."
70,"Samsung has added a Voice Recorder widget to the lock screen. It lets you record voice memos without unlocking your phone, making it easier and quicker to record voice. Additionally, Samsung also has added a Calendar widget on the lockscreen which shall help you keep track of your events along with a month view."
71,"Yes, you can finally use third-party app icon packs on Galaxy smartphones and tablets running Android 12-based One UI 4.0. However, the feature isn’t available by default. You’ll have to use Samsung’s Good Lock app to use third-party app icons."
72,"Samsung has focused on improving privacy and security settings and reporting with the One UI 4 update. You can see which apps are accessing sensitive permissions such as camera, clipboard, location, and microphone in the Permission Usage History section of the Settings app. You can even go back as long as seven days to check which apps have accessed sensitive data. You can choose to deny permissions for any apps you don’t feel comfortable with. You can also set if an app can access your approximate location or precise location."
73,Samsung also has brought a couple of new features in Accessibility mode. One such feature is the Extra Dim which makes the screen dimmer than usual. It can be found in the Accessibility settings of the smartphone or tablet. You can even change the screen brightness intensity.
74,"Apart from these notable changes, there are more than 60 new features that Samsung has introduced with its newer One UI version, and you can find all of them in the official changelog below."
75,"Samsung is the only brand that has been keeping its promise of pushing Android updates and security patches on time. The South Korean firm had announced in February 2021 that it would offer four years of security updates to its devices. It had also revealed that some mid-range smartphones and all high-end smartphones will get three major Android OS updates. It means that the Galaxy S10 lineup will get the One UI 4.0 update. Moreover, there is no doubt that the Galaxy devices released in 2020 and 2021 shall receive the One UI 4 update."
76,"In early 2022, Samsung announced that all high-end and some mid-range Galaxy smartphones and tablets will get four years of Android OS updates and five years of security updates. All high-end smartphones starting with the Galaxy S20 series will get four major Android OS updates."
77,"Samsung released the Android 12-based One UI 4.0 update to the Galaxy S21 series first in November 2021. Later, more high-end and mid-range smartphones and tablets received the update globally. Over the next few months, more entry-level and mid-range smartphones and tablets will get the One UI 4.0 update."
78,"Some devices could go straight to the Android 12-based One UI 4.1 update, which has already been released to the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy Z Fold 3, and the Galaxy Z Flip 3."
79,"To join Samsung’s One UI 4.0 Beta Program, you have to download the Samsung Members app. Once you download the app, open it, and register on it, you will see a banner for the One UI Beta Program registration. Click on that banner image and then hit the ‘Enrol’ button. After you have registered your One UI 4.0 Beta Program eligible Galaxy smartphone, head over to Settings > Software Update > Download and Install on your smartphone. If the Beta Progam has been released in your country, you should get the update."

194,Samsung briefly published an update rollout schedule for One UI 4 on its Members app before abruptly taking it down. The complete list includes a monthly update plan breakdown spanning from now  to July 2022. The fact that the list was later removed means that its probably still being finalized and Samsung might change dates in the future.

211,"What is the best Samsung phone? The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G is ZDNets top choice. We analyzed processor, display, camera capabilities, battery, and storage options to find the best Samsung Phone on the market. Watch out Apple!"
212,"Matthew Miller started using mobile devices in 1997 and has been writing news, reviews, and opinion pieces ever since. He was a co-host, with Kevin Tofel, of the MobileTechRoundup podcast for 13 years and authored three Wiley Companion series books."
213,Michael is a veteran technology writer who has been covering business and consumer-focused hardware and software for over a decade.
214,"Samsung continues to battle Huawei and Apple for the crown of best smartphone, and to help sales, we find the company releasing more mid-range phones that are extremely capable while also offering innovative folding devices. Samsung is clearly the leader in foldable technology and its new S22 series shows it is working to be the best across the board."
215,"Samsungs latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, is a stunning feat of engineering that we found to be a significant improvement over its predecessor. The Galaxy S22 series and the compelling A-Series offer more traditional smartphone designs with features that challenge the best available phones."
216,Tech specs
217,"The 2020 Galaxy Z Fold 2 set the bar for foldable devices that also serve as mini tablets. At first glance, the Z Fold 3 may appear to be just a minor update to the Z Fold 2, but at a starting price $200 less (with holiday discounts dropping the model even further), Samsung provides S Pen support and IPX8 water resistance. These were two features many have asked for and Samsung delivered once again."
218,"In addition to a couple of new features, the cover display resolution and refresh rate were updated so you get a high-resolution display with 120 Hz support constructed of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. The main display has improved panels and a screen protector that provide an 80% increase in its durability. The three main cameras are basically the same, but the new under display camera is a step forward in mobile technology thats great for video conferencing, even if it cant quite compete yet with its more obvious counterparts."
219,Pros
220,Cons
221,Tech specs
222,"Samsungs first flagship phone of 2022 was released as the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. While the S21 Ultra from 2021 supported the S Pen, there was no way to store, carry, or charge up the S Pen. With the S22 Ultra, Samsung has fully embraced it as the Note successor with an S Pen silo, flat and square design elements, and all of the latest and greatest specifications in a smartphone."
223,"The Galaxy S22 phones were the first to launch widely with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor inside. While the same resolution cameras are found in this years S22 Ultra, Samsung improved the cameras capabilities, especially in terms of low-light shooting. With two telephoto cameras, Samsung stands out from Apple and Google with fantastic zoom capability."
224,Pros
225,Cons
226,Tech specs
227,"If you are a Note user then the S22 Ultra is the model to purchase. However, if you like a slightly smaller phone that is also extremely capable, then the S22 Plus should satisfy your needs."
228,"The Galaxy S22 Plus has a 50MP camera instead of the 108MP one found in the S22 Ultra, but it still provides a very capable still and video camera experience. The S22 Plus supports 45W fast charging, ultra wideband, WiFi 6E, and 5G. It is constructed with an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus."
229,Four color options are available for the S22 Plus so you can find one that fits your style. Pricing starts at $999.99.
230,Pros
231,Cons
232,Tech specs
233,"While the Galaxy S22 series provide compelling options, they are flagship phones priced in the $800 and higher range. In order to offer customers another alternative, Samsung released the Galaxy S21 FE (Fan Edition) phone. The S21 FE is available in four unique colors to suit your style."
234,"Priced at $699.99, you may think Samsung compromised a lot to offer a powerful 5G phone. However, we see a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, large capacity 4500mAh battery, 6 or 8GB of RAM, 128 or 256GB storage with a microSD card slot, IP68 dust/water resistance, three rear cameras (one with 3X optical and 30x super-resolution zoom), and a high resolution 32MP front camera."
235,"Where are the compromises? Exactly, there really arent any and yet the $700 price is where we see phones in the upper mid-range with less capable specs appear. The S21 FE challenges Googles new Pixel 6 and other phones."
236,Pros
237,Cons
238,Tech specs
239,"Like the Z Fold 3, the Z Flip 3 is the third generation Flip device from Samsung. One significant improvement is the increased size of the cover screen display from 1.1 to 1.9 inches. The other major change is the IPX8 water resistance that gives you peace of mind when you are flipping open and closed out in the weather."
240,"The $200 price drop on the Z Flip 3 means you can now join the foldable sector for $1000, which is competitive to other flagship smartphones and gives the Z Flip 3 the potential to seriously challenge other manufacturers while expanding the adoption of foldable devices."
241,"Battery life was a concern with the last generation model so well have to see how the processor, Android 11, and Samsung software enhancements impact the battery life on the Z Flip 3."
242,Pros
243,Cons
244,Tech specs
245,"Samsung offers three options in the A-Series lineup with the A52 5G, A42 5G, and A32 5G. As noted by the name, this years A-Series phones all support 5G networks and are solid options for first time smartphone owners or those looking for an affordable phone."
246,"One distinguishing element of the A-Series is the high capacity battery that is sure to get you through a day or two. We also find water resistance, high refresh rate displays, and other core Samsung features in these affordable phones."
247,Pros
248,Cons
249,"We found the best Samsung phone is the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. It is superior in camera capabilities, processor speed, and battery life, and it rivals its greatest competitors like Apple and Huawei."
250,"It was much easier to choose a Samsung phone option in the past when just the S and Note series were available, along with some low-range basic phones. Samsung has significantly expanded its offerings with the A Series, Fold, and Flip options so now the first thing to consider is your desired form factor."
251,"First, decide if you want a standard glass rectangle smartphone or if you want a foliding device. For maximum screen real estate, get a Z Fold 3. Or, for taking up the minimum space in your pocket and providing that extra bit of style, get a Z Flip 3 5G."
252,"If you choose a standard form factor, then price is the next factor to consider. With Samsungs new strategy you have phones priced from under $250 to over $1,200. So, your budget should quickly help you figure out which price point is right for your. From there, consider whether or not you need stylus support, or if youd prefer some of the best camera arrays around."
253,We try to spend time with every phone in our best list and if we dont get that opportunity then we look to trusted reviewers in the mobile space. We only include phones that are still readily available since Samsung tends to clear the queue when new models are launched.
254,"While we personally spend most of our time with higher-end models that help us get our work done most efficiently, there are mid-range phones worth consideration so we include them as well."
255,"The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. Priced at $699.99, it features a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, large capacity 4500mAh battery, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 128 or 256GB storage with a microSD card slot, IP68 dust/water resistance, three rear cameras (one with 3X optical and 30x super-resolution zoom), and a high resolution 32MP front camera."

The complete list includes a monthly update plan breakdown spanning from now  to July 2022.

436,"Samsung’s latest tablet devices, Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7+, are packed with a versatile range of productivity and connectivity features to help users connect and get more done on their own terms."
437,"With the latest One UI 3 software update, announced at the recent Galaxy Unpacked 2021 event, Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ users can do even more with their tablets and enhance their connected experiences with the newly-launched Galaxy S21 series and Galaxy Buds Pro1."
438,You can now move across devices more seamlessly than ever before2 –between your Galaxy Tab S7 or S7+ and Galaxy S213 – as you can easily copy text or images on your smartphone and instantly paste the content onto your Tab S7 or S7+ – and vice versa.
439,"You can also enjoy uninterrupted continuation of your Samsung Internet browsing and faster auto-sync of Samsung Notes across connected devices. This helps when you are browsing on your Galaxy S21, you want to continue what you are doing on a bigger display. After browsing a webpage on your Galaxy S21 device, click the ‘Recents’ button on your Galaxy Tab S7 or S7+. With a simple tap of the Samsung Internet icon on the menu’s bottom right, your most recently accessed page will load.4"
440,"Sometimes when working or creating remotely, two screens are better than one. In order to easily extend your screen space, you can harness the Second screen feature to connect your Galaxy Tab S7 or S7+ with your laptop5 through a range of different modes. Extend mode lets you connect to your Windows PC and work across two different apps on each screen, while Duplicated mode lets you share the apps or documents you have open on your tablet directly to your laptop screen and instantly save any changes straight to your laptop."
441,"In order to provide a more convenient keyboard experience across devices, you can now take advantage of the Wireless Keyboard Sharing6 feature, which allows you to connect your Book Cover Keyboard to your smartphone7 as well as your tablet device and effortlessly switch between the two8. You can also harness the Keyboard’s touchpad to control and manage your smartphone with the cursor as you would your tablet."
442,"Earphone users will know the inconvenience of having to manually disconnect and reconnect their earphones when switching devices. This is where the Auto Switch functionality comes in, which allows you to enjoy media on your Galaxy Buds Pro across devices much quicker by automatically switching connections9. For example, if you get a call while you’re watching YouTube on your Tab S7 or S7+, your Galaxy Buds Pro will automatically switch to your smartphone. You can answer the call by tapping the Buds once or pressing the “Call” button on your smartphone."

468,"When Samsung launched the Galaxy S20 FE last year, it said the new Fan Edition lineup was a tribute to Galaxy fans that set “a new standard of making uncompromising flagship innovations accessible to as many people as possible.” During the launch event, the company also promised it would launch “Fan Editions of our flagship devices in the years to come.”"
469,"So when Samsung reached out to send over a review unit of the new Galaxy Tab S7 FE, I expected to receive an affordable version of the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus with perhaps a few missing features. However, the device I’ve been using for the last ten days is anything but that."
470,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE only has a total of three features in common with the flagship Galaxy Tab S7+ — the display size, battery capacity, and One UI — and in my opinion, it doesn’t deserve the FE moniker. Samsung should have just called it the Galaxy Tab S7 Lite (as previous leaks and rumors suggested) because the “FE” tag will only mislead fans."
471,About this review: I received the 6GB/128GB version of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE (LTE) from Samsung India for this review. Samsung had no inputs in any part of this review.
472,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE looks quite like the flagship Galaxy Tab S7+. It has a similar metal chassis with square edges, a tiny pill-shaped camera module in the top right corner on the back, antenna lines on the left and right edges, and Samsung branding in the top left corner. The only obvious difference between the two is that the Galaxy Tab S7 FE doesn’t feature a glass strip next to the camera module. That’s because the flagship model came with an active S Pen that charged wirelessly when placed on the glass strip. Since the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s S Pen is just a glorified stylus, Samsung has removed the glass strip from the tablet."
473,"Over on the front, the tablet features a 12.4-inch TFT LCD (2560 x 1600) that has a 16:10 aspect ratio, 60Hz refresh rate, and minimal bezels on all sides. While the display is great for content consumption and gets bright enough for outdoor use, it’s a bit underwhelming for the asking price. I expected to see a 60Hz AMOLED panel or a high refresh rate LCD at this price point, but that’s sadly not the case."
474,"The power button, volume rocker, and SIM tray on the Galaxy Tab S7 FE all reside on the top edge, while the USB Type-C port can be found on the right edge. The tablet features a dual speaker setup tuned by AKG, another downgrade from the flagship models. It features the same proprietary keyboard connector at the bottom edge, which is compatible with the keyboard accessories designed for the Galaxy Tab S7+. The tablet features a front-facing camera, which resides in the center of the top bezel."
475,"Overall, the Galaxy Tab S7 FE feels just as premium as the flagship Galaxy Tab S7+. But it lacks a few crucial features you would expect to see on a tablet that costs over ₹45,000 (~$600), such as a fingerprint scanner. Yeah, you read that right. The Galaxy Tab S7 FE doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. Software-enabled Face Unlock is the only mode of biometric authentication on the tablet — and we all know how secure that is."
476,"While the Fan Edition label might lead you to believe the Galaxy Tab S7 FE packs a flagship SoC, it doesn’t. The tablet features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 750G, which is a mid-range chipset found on affordable devices like the OnePlus Nord CE. The SoC is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage on the base model, while the higher-end variant gets 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Since I recently reviewed the OnePlus Nord CE, which also packs the same SoC, I was expecting the tablet to perform just as well, if not better. But it didn’t."
477,"Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE is just good enough for light workloads and media consumption. So if you’re planning on getting some serious work done or play demanding games on the tablet, then you should probably look elsewhere. While using the tablet over the last two weeks, I noticed a couple of issues with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE that may turn buyers away. The tablet stuttered quite often when I had more than a couple of Chrome tabs open for work, it froze while playing demanding games like COD: Mobile at medium to high graphics settings, and it took far too long to switch to DeX mode."
478,"While playing videos on YouTube, the tablet worked fine as long as I stuck to the auto or 1080p video quality preset. But the video stuttered as I switched to a higher quality preset. It’s also worth noting that the tablet’s speakers, while pretty decent for the most part, crackled at high volume in some situations. Here’s a sample:"
479,I’m not sure if the issue is limited to my review unit or not.
480,"If you care about synthetic benchmarks, here’s a quick look at the results posted by the Galaxy Tab S7 FE:"
481,"In Geekbench 5, the tablet got a single-core score of 650 and a multi-core score of 1,882. In 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test, it got an overall score of 2,320, and it scored 33.3 in Browserbench’s Speedometer 2.0 web benchmark. In Androbench, the tablet delivered sequential read speeds of 899.63MB/s and sequential write speeds of 487.62MB/s."
482,"I have no complaints about the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s battery life. It performed reasonably well, with a four hour Netflix binge session at full brightness consuming around 50 percent of the battery. While doing only browser-based tasks, the tablet lasted just about two days on a single charge."
483,"While the tablet’s battery performance was decent, its charging speeds were atrocious. That’s because it ships with a 15W charger in the box, even though it supports 45W fast charging. The charger took well over three hours to charge the 10,090mAh battery on the tablet from 0-100%, which is rather unacceptable. I’m disappointed that Samsung still doesn’t ship a faster charger with its tablets, but that was to be expected as the company ships the same 15W brick with its flagship Galaxy Tab S7."
484,"As mentioned earlier, the S Pen that comes with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE isn’t the same as the one you get with the flagship models. It’s just a glorified stylus that doesn’t support any of the premium features you get with the active S Pen. In addition to that, it doesn’t offer the same 9ms ultra-low latency as the active S Pen you get with the Galaxy Note 20 or Galaxy Tab S7 series. Instead, it promises <30ms latency, which isn’t all that great for writing or drawing."
485,"The keyboard folio case for the Galaxy Tab S7 FE is also a downgrade. While it’s similar to the keyboard folio for the Galaxy Tab S7 in terms of design and build quality, it doesn’t feature a trackpad. This makes working on the tab a bit annoying, as you have to use the touch screen for all the tasks you would otherwise perform with a mouse or trackpad."
486,"I don’t see which “uncompromising flagship innovations” the Galaxy Tab S7 FE makes more accessible for buyers. It’s just a mid-range tablet with a large screen and a large battery, and it fails to justify the Fan Edition moniker. In my opinion, Samsung should’ve offered the Galaxy Tab S7 FE with an older flagship chip. That would’ve addressed the performance issues while keeping the cost low."
487,"Speaking of which, the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s price tag also makes it hard to recommend. You can get a regular iPad or the iPad Air for a similar price. Both of those options undoubtedly offer better performance and they’re significantly better tablets overall. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 is also a much better purchase, and it’s often available at attractive discounts that bring its price down to the same level."
488,I honestly expected Samsung to offer users better value with its Fan Edition devices. I hope upcoming Fan Edition phones or tablets aren’t as disappointing as the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.
