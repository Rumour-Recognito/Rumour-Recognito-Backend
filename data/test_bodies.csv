34,"Update (11/17/2021 @ 01:56 ET): Samsung has officially shared the One UI 4.0 rollout timeline for the US. Scroll to the bottom for more information. The article as published on November 15, 2021, is preserved below."
35,"Over the last few weeks, Samsung has released One UI 4.0 beta updates based on Android 12 to quite a few of its devices. The flagship Galaxy S21 series has already received four closed beta builds of One UI 4.0, while older models like the Galaxy S20 series and Galaxy Note 20 series just joined the beta program. The company’s latest foldables, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, have also received beta builds of Samsung’s latest software skin, and a new notice on the Samsung Members app suggests that the stable builds might start rolling out soon."
36,"Hands-on with Samsung One UI 4.0 Beta 2: Theming, Virtual RAM, and more!"
37,"Samsung seems to have accidentally pushed a notice on the Samsung Members app (via @FrontTron), revealing the One UI 4.0 stable rollout schedule for its devices. As per the notice, One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 will start rolling out to the Galaxy S21 series this month, followed by the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy Note 20 series, Galaxy S20 series, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Galaxy Z Flip in December. Check out the image attached below to see when other devices in Samsung’s portfolio will receive the new update:"
38,(Via: @FrontTron)
39,"Samsung rolled out a similar notice on the Samsung Members app to users in Brazil. However, the rollout schedule isn’t the same in that region. As per a recent post on the Samsung community forums, the company plans to release stable builds of One UI 4.0 based on Android 12 to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 in December this year, followed by the Galaxy S21 series, the Galaxy Z Flip 3, the Galaxy Z Flip, and Galaxy Z Fold 2 in January next year. See the table below for the rollout schedule for other Samsung devices in Brazil:"
40,"Note that Samsung has since removed the notice in both regions. This leads us to believe that the company is still ironing out the final details, and it may change the rollout schedule for some devices. However, Samsung seems to have finalized the One UI 4.0 rollout schedule for the Galaxy S21 series as Canadian telecom giants Rogers and Telus have confirmed that the Android 12 update will roll out to the devices on November 23. This suggests that unlocked models in other regions will likely receive the update by next week."
41,"Samsung has officially announced that the stable rollout of One UI 4.0 has officially begun, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21+, and Galaxy S21 Ultra, with rollout beginning today. We’ll shortly be updating our One UI 4 Update Tracker with download links so you can easily sideload the new update."
42,"The company did not reveal further timelines beyond its flagship S series, but these are the devices that will get the update:"
43,"Samsung has now shared the official One UI 4.0 rollout timeline for the US region through the Samsung Members app (via Android Authority). As per the schedule, Samsung plans to release the stable Android 12 update to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 next month, followed by the Galaxy S20 series, Galaxy Note 20 series, and older foldables in January next year.

64,"Ever since Google announced Android 12, Samsung hasn’t kept quiet. Since mid-September, Samsung has been testing the One UI 4 on the Samsung Galaxy S21 series and it’s available in a public beta. And with its latest release, It is much more polished and on track for its final stable release. This update has many of the features included in the AOSP Android 12. In this post, we will go through the main One UI 4 features introduced in this build, the release date in India, steps to try it out early, and the update roadmap."

66,"Samsung officially unveiled this new build on October 20th at the global Unpacked Part 2 launch event. Right now, a majority of the Samsung smartphones are running the One UI 3.1 build, and a majority of them are slated to get the new One UI 4 in the coming months. The One UI 4 build is based on Android 12, and the first beta was released on 13th September."
67,"While the One UI 4 update might not seem as massive at first, it sure does bring some big changes to the Android skin. Samsung has tried its best to keep its UI similar to the older One UI while incorporating as many Android 12 features as possible. Let’s dive into some of OneUI 4 core features."
68,"The new One UI 4 update has brought some visual changes across the UI. There is now a Wallpaper Theming system that was introduced in Android 12, where the system will dynamically change colours according to the wallpaper you have applied. The wallpaper theming will be applied across the entire system be it the Settings app, or stock Samsung dialer and messages app. It makes your phone more colourful, to say the least."
69,"The camera app also has received some changes. The annoying trees that depict the zoom level are gone and are replaced with the proper zoom levels, be it 0.6x or 100x. It also shows properly at which zoom level you are on. In addition, the Pro mode has a new level indicator which is enabled when you toggle on the grid lines. There is now an option to scan a QR code within the camera app and you can either copy the URL or directly open it into the browser."
70,"The device care has been refreshed with an emoji that tells you the score for your device status. You can also check software updates and diagnostics right from device care now. Apart from this, the protect battery function, which is usually seen in Samsung tablets has made its way to the S21 series; however, we’re not sure whether it will apply to every Samsung phone receiving the One UI 4 update."
71,"In the Calendar app, there is a bar at the bottom that lets you quickly add events without tapping the date. The weather app also has a fresh UI, and it changes dynamically as you scroll down. Additionally, the Samsung keyboard now has Grammarly indication built-in so that you can avoid typing incorrect sentences. Also, on the keyboard, the emojis, stickers and GIFs are now all under one animated app icon, so you can get easy access."
72,"Unsurprisingly, the RAM Plus feature, which is similar to the virtual RAM feature on OPPO, Xiaomi, and Vivo, has also made its way in One UI 4. The feature uses your internal storage to dynamically expand your RAM up to 4GB. It is yet to be seen if all the devices will get this feature in One UI 4."
73,"In addition to the core features, the One UI 4 also comes with a host of Android 12 features. There is a new permission history under the privacy settings where you can see app usage permissions over the last 24 hours. You can go back as long as 7 days for sensitive permissions including camera, location and microphone. The One UI 4 also features Android 12 privacy indicators. So, if an app tries to access your camera or microphone, you will immediately see an indicator in the top right corner of the screen."
74,"Under privacy settings, there are toggle buttons for camera and microphone access. Once disabled, all apps with access to the camera or microphone will have their permit revoked. The same toggles are available in quick settings as well. In addition, now there is an option to give an approximate location to apps instead of your precise location. The toggle is available with location permission for each app."
75,"Another nifty feature Samsung has brought is “Extra Dim.” As the name suggests, you can dim the screen beyond the minimum screen brightness. It is handy for all those night owls who like to read at night. One UI also has gotten better in overall fluidity and performance. The shutter delay on the camera app is gone now."
76,"Samsung has improved its update cycle tremendously since the last few years, and with the announcement of up to 3 years of OS updates meaning most of the devices released from 2018 would also get the One UI Update. Here is the timeline of eligible devices and the month when they will get the update. We will update the article as soon as other devices are added."
77,"December 2021: Galaxy Z Fold3 5G, Z Flip3 5G, S21 Ultra, S21+, S21."
78,"January 2022: Galaxy Fold, S10e, S10, S10+, S10 Lite, Note 10/10+, Note 10 Lite,  Galaxy Z Flip, S20 FE LTE/5G, S20, S20+, S20 Ultra 5G, Note20, Note20 Ultra 5G, Z Fold2 5G/LTE."

206,Samsung briefly published an update rollout schedule for One UI 4 on its Members app before abruptly taking it down. The complete list includes a monthly update plan breakdown spanning from now  to July 2022. The fact that the list was later removed means that its probably still being finalized and Samsung might change dates in the future.

209,"The Galaxy S10 trio, S20 FE, Note 10 pair, original Galaxy Fold and Z Flip will be among the first devices to get One UI 4 in January 2022. The midrange Galaxy A52s 5G and A42 5G are also listed for that time frame."

220,"ZDNet’s recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping.

And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we’re assessing."

This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNet nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews.  Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers."
222,"ZDNets editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader. Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services. Our editors thoroughly review and fact-check every article to ensure that our content meets the highest standards. If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form."
223,"What is the best Samsung phone? The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G is ZDNets top choice. We analyzed processor, display, camera capabilities, battery, and storage options to find the best Samsung Phone on the market. Watch out Apple!"
224,"Matthew Miller started using mobile devices in 1997 and has been writing news, reviews, and opinion pieces ever since. He was a co-host, with Kevin Tofel, of the MobileTechRoundup podcast for 13 years and authored three Wiley Companion series books."
225,Michael is a veteran technology writer who has been covering business and consumer-focused hardware and software for over a decade.
226,"Samsung continues to battle Huawei and Apple for the crown of best smartphone, and to help sales, we find the company releasing more mid-range phones that are extremely capable while also offering innovative folding devices. Samsung is clearly the leader in foldable technology and its new S22 series shows it is working to be the best across the board."
227,"Samsungs latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, is a stunning feat of engineering that we found to be a significant improvement over its predecessor. The Galaxy S22 series and the compelling A-Series offer more traditional smartphone designs with features that challenge the best available phones."
228,Tech specs
229,"The 2020 Galaxy Z Fold 2 set the bar for foldable devices that also serve as mini tablets. At first glance, the Z Fold 3 may appear to be just a minor update to the Z Fold 2, but at a starting price $200 less (with holiday discounts dropping the model even further), Samsung provides S Pen support and IPX8 water resistance. These were two features many have asked for and Samsung delivered once again."
230,"In addition to a couple of new features, the cover display resolution and refresh rate were updated so you get a high-resolution display with 120 Hz support constructed of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. The main display has improved panels and a screen protector that provide an 80% increase in its durability. The three main cameras are basically the same, but the new under display camera is a step forward in mobile technology thats great for video conferencing, even if it cant quite compete yet with its more obvious counterparts."
231,Pros
232,Cons
233,Tech specs
234,"Samsungs first flagship phone of 2022 was released as the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. While the S21 Ultra from 2021 supported the S Pen, there was no way to store, carry, or charge up the S Pen. With the S22 Ultra, Samsung has fully embraced it as the Note successor with an S Pen silo, flat and square design elements, and all of the latest and greatest specifications in a smartphone."
235,"The Galaxy S22 phones were the first to launch widely with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor inside. While the same resolution cameras are found in this years S22 Ultra, Samsung improved the cameras capabilities, especially in terms of low-light shooting. With two telephoto cameras, Samsung stands out from Apple and Google with fantastic zoom capability."
236,Pros
237,Cons
238,Tech specs
239,"If you are a Note user then the S22 Ultra is the model to purchase. However, if you like a slightly smaller phone that is also extremely capable, then the S22 Plus should satisfy your needs."
240,"The Galaxy S22 Plus has a 50MP camera instead of the 108MP one found in the S22 Ultra, but it still provides a very capable still and video camera experience. The S22 Plus supports 45W fast charging, ultra wideband, WiFi 6E, and 5G. It is constructed with an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus."
241,Four color options are available for the S22 Plus so you can find one that fits your style. Pricing starts at $999.99.
242,Pros
243,Cons
244,Tech specs
245,"While the Galaxy S22 series provide compelling options, they are flagship phones priced in the $800 and higher range. In order to offer customers another alternative, Samsung released the Galaxy S21 FE (Fan Edition) phone. The S21 FE is available in four unique colors to suit your style."
246,"Priced at $699.99, you may think Samsung compromised a lot to offer a powerful 5G phone. However, we see a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, large capacity 4500mAh battery, 6 or 8GB of RAM, 128 or 256GB storage with a microSD card slot, IP68 dust/water resistance, three rear cameras (one with 3X optical and 30x super-resolution zoom), and a high resolution 32MP front camera."
247,"Where are the compromises? Exactly, there really arent any and yet the $700 price is where we see phones in the upper mid-range with less capable specs appear. The S21 FE challenges Googles new Pixel 6 and other phones."
248,Pros
249,Cons
250,Tech specs
251,"Like the Z Fold 3, the Z Flip 3 is the third generation Flip device from Samsung. One significant improvement is the increased size of the cover screen display from 1.1 to 1.9 inches. The other major change is the IPX8 water resistance that gives you peace of mind when you are flipping open and closed out in the weather."
252,"The $200 price drop on the Z Flip 3 means you can now join the foldable sector for $1000, which is competitive to other flagship smartphones and gives the Z Flip 3 the potential to seriously challenge other manufacturers while expanding the adoption of foldable devices."
253,"Battery life was a concern with the last generation model so well have to see how the processor, Android 11, and Samsung software enhancements impact the battery life on the Z Flip 3."
254,Pros
255,Cons
256,Tech specs
257,"Samsung offers three options in the A-Series lineup with the A52 5G, A42 5G, and A32 5G. As noted by the name, this years A-Series phones all support 5G networks and are solid options for first time smartphone owners or those looking for an affordable phone."
258,"One distinguishing element of the A-Series is the high capacity battery that is sure to get you through a day or two. We also find water resistance, high refresh rate displays, and other core Samsung features in these affordable phones."
259,Pros
260,Cons
261,"We found the best Samsung phone is the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G. It is superior in camera capabilities, processor speed, and battery life, and it rivals its greatest competitors like Apple and Huawei."
262,"It was much easier to choose a Samsung phone option in the past when just the S and Note series were available, along with some low-range basic phones. Samsung has significantly expanded its offerings with the A Series, Fold, and Flip options so now the first thing to consider is your desired form factor."
263,"First, decide if you want a standard glass rectangle smartphone or if you want a foliding device. For maximum screen real estate, get a Z Fold 3. Or, for taking up the minimum space in your pocket and providing that extra bit of style, get a Z Flip 3 5G."
264,"If you choose a standard form factor, then price is the next factor to consider. With Samsungs new strategy you have phones priced from under $250 to over $1,200. So, your budget should quickly help you figure out which price point is right for your. From there, consider whether or not you need stylus support, or if youd prefer some of the best camera arrays around."
265,We try to spend time with every phone in our best list and if we dont get that opportunity then we look to trusted reviewers in the mobile space. We only include phones that are still readily available since Samsung tends to clear the queue when new models are launched.
266,"While we personally spend most of our time with higher-end models that help us get our work done most efficiently, there are mid-range phones worth consideration so we include them as well."
267,"The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE. Priced at $699.99, it features a 6.4-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate, high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, large capacity 4500mAh battery, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 128 or 256GB storage with a microSD card slot, IP68 dust/water resistance, three rear cameras (one with 3X optical and 30x super-resolution zoom), and a high resolution 32MP front camera."

474,"When Samsung launched the Galaxy S20 FE last year, it said the new Fan Edition lineup was a tribute to Galaxy fans that set “a new standard of making uncompromising flagship innovations accessible to as many people as possible.” During the launch event, the company also promised it would launch “Fan Editions of our flagship devices in the years to come.”"
475,"So when Samsung reached out to send over a review unit of the new Galaxy Tab S7 FE, I expected to receive an affordable version of the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus with perhaps a few missing features. However, the device I’ve been using for the last ten days is anything but that."
476,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE only has a total of three features in common with the flagship Galaxy Tab S7+ — the display size, battery capacity, and One UI — and in my opinion, it doesn’t deserve the FE moniker. Samsung should have just called it the Galaxy Tab S7 Lite (as previous leaks and rumors suggested) because the “FE” tag will only mislead fans."
477,About this review: I received the 6GB/128GB version of the Galaxy Tab S7 FE (LTE) from Samsung India for this review. Samsung had no inputs in any part of this review.
478,"The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE looks quite like the flagship Galaxy Tab S7+. It has a similar metal chassis with square edges, a tiny pill-shaped camera module in the top right corner on the back, antenna lines on the left and right edges, and Samsung branding in the top left corner. The only obvious difference between the two is that the Galaxy Tab S7 FE doesn’t feature a glass strip next to the camera module. That’s because the flagship model came with an active S Pen that charged wirelessly when placed on the glass strip. Since the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s S Pen is just a glorified stylus, Samsung has removed the glass strip from the tablet."
479,"Over on the front, the tablet features a 12.4-inch TFT LCD (2560 x 1600) that has a 16:10 aspect ratio, 60Hz refresh rate, and minimal bezels on all sides. While the display is great for content consumption and gets bright enough for outdoor use, it’s a bit underwhelming for the asking price. I expected to see a 60Hz AMOLED panel or a high refresh rate LCD at this price point, but that’s sadly not the case."
480,"The power button, volume rocker, and SIM tray on the Galaxy Tab S7 FE all reside on the top edge, while the USB Type-C port can be found on the right edge. The tablet features a dual speaker setup tuned by AKG, another downgrade from the flagship models. It features the same proprietary keyboard connector at the bottom edge, which is compatible with the keyboard accessories designed for the Galaxy Tab S7+. The tablet features a front-facing camera, which resides in the center of the top bezel."
481,"Overall, the Galaxy Tab S7 FE feels just as premium as the flagship Galaxy Tab S7+. But it lacks a few crucial features you would expect to see on a tablet that costs over ₹45,000 (~$600), such as a fingerprint scanner. Yeah, you read that right. The Galaxy Tab S7 FE doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner. Software-enabled Face Unlock is the only mode of biometric authentication on the tablet — and we all know how secure that is."
482,"While the Fan Edition label might lead you to believe the Galaxy Tab S7 FE packs a flagship SoC, it doesn’t. The tablet features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 750G, which is a mid-range chipset found on affordable devices like the OnePlus Nord CE. The SoC is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage on the base model, while the higher-end variant gets 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Since I recently reviewed the OnePlus Nord CE, which also packs the same SoC, I was expecting the tablet to perform just as well, if not better. But it didn’t."
483,"Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE is just good enough for light workloads and media consumption. So if you’re planning on getting some serious work done or play demanding games on the tablet, then you should probably look elsewhere. While using the tablet over the last two weeks, I noticed a couple of issues with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE that may turn buyers away. The tablet stuttered quite often when I had more than a couple of Chrome tabs open for work, it froze while playing demanding games like COD: Mobile at medium to high graphics settings, and it took far too long to switch to DeX mode."
484,"While playing videos on YouTube, the tablet worked fine as long as I stuck to the auto or 1080p video quality preset. But the video stuttered as I switched to a higher quality preset. It’s also worth noting that the tablet’s speakers, while pretty decent for the most part, crackled at high volume in some situations. Here’s a sample:"
485,I’m not sure if the issue is limited to my review unit or not.
486,"If you care about synthetic benchmarks, here’s a quick look at the results posted by the Galaxy Tab S7 FE:"
487,"In Geekbench 5, the tablet got a single-core score of 650 and a multi-core score of 1,882. In 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test, it got an overall score of 2,320, and it scored 33.3 in Browserbench’s Speedometer 2.0 web benchmark. In Androbench, the tablet delivered sequential read speeds of 899.63MB/s and sequential write speeds of 487.62MB/s."
488,"I have no complaints about the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s battery life. It performed reasonably well, with a four hour Netflix binge session at full brightness consuming around 50 percent of the battery. While doing only browser-based tasks, the tablet lasted just about two days on a single charge."
489,"While the tablet’s battery performance was decent, its charging speeds were atrocious. That’s because it ships with a 15W charger in the box, even though it supports 45W fast charging. The charger took well over three hours to charge the 10,090mAh battery on the tablet from 0-100%, which is rather unacceptable. I’m disappointed that Samsung still doesn’t ship a faster charger with its tablets, but that was to be expected as the company ships the same 15W brick with its flagship Galaxy Tab S7."
490,"As mentioned earlier, the S Pen that comes with the Galaxy Tab S7 FE isn’t the same as the one you get with the flagship models. It’s just a glorified stylus that doesn’t support any of the premium features you get with the active S Pen. In addition to that, it doesn’t offer the same 9ms ultra-low latency as the active S Pen you get with the Galaxy Note 20 or Galaxy Tab S7 series. Instead, it promises <30ms latency, which isn’t all that great for writing or drawing."
491,"The keyboard folio case for the Galaxy Tab S7 FE is also a downgrade. While it’s similar to the keyboard folio for the Galaxy Tab S7 in terms of design and build quality, it doesn’t feature a trackpad. This makes working on the tab a bit annoying, as you have to use the touch screen for all the tasks you would otherwise perform with a mouse or trackpad."
492,"I don’t see which “uncompromising flagship innovations” the Galaxy Tab S7 FE makes more accessible for buyers. It’s just a mid-range tablet with a large screen and a large battery, and it fails to justify the Fan Edition moniker. In my opinion, Samsung should’ve offered the Galaxy Tab S7 FE with an older flagship chip. That would’ve addressed the performance issues while keeping the cost low."
493,"Speaking of which, the Galaxy Tab S7 FE’s price tag also makes it hard to recommend. You can get a regular iPad or the iPad Air for a similar price. Both of those options undoubtedly offer better performance and they’re significantly better tablets overall. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 is also a much better purchase, and it’s often available at attractive discounts that bring its price down to the same level."
494,I honestly expected Samsung to offer users better value with its Fan Edition devices. I hope upcoming Fan Edition phones or tablets aren’t as disappointing as the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.
